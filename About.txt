completed BSc CS at coimbatore kasc
pursuing MCA at sastra

First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.

I am KAVINKISHORE E from Namakkal. I am currently pursuing my MCA at SASTRA University, Thanjavur, with a CGPA of 8.6 up to the 3rd semester. I completed my BCA at SASTRA University, SRC Campus, Kumbakonam, with a CGPA of 7.4.

Apart from academics, I completed an internship in full-stack development at Tech Vaseegrah, where I worked with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). During this time, I gained experience in building web applications, connecting APIs, and designing user-friendly interfaces.

I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems, and constantly improving my skills. I also believe in the importance of teamwork and adaptability.

That's all about me.
